            My favourite hobby is reading. It is very knowledgable as well as intersting. I love to read books in my free time, reading books is always an advantage for us. It provides us good vocabulary and our english speaking and writing skills are improved with the help of reading good books. Many children see reading as study but I don't agree with them. <br>Reading helps me to have a calm state of mind, strenghts my brain,helps prevent stress and there are many more advantages of reading.It is the best, it doesnt have any disadvange except our eyes get weak if we read in dark, but there is always a solution,which is that we can use a lamp or a reading light. There are many novels which are very inspiring! I proudly say I LOVE READING!<br /> </p>
